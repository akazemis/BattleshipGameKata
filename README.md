# Battleship Game
A simple code kata to implement the battleship game. The idea here was to implement the state tracker part of the game that includes the following functionalities:

* Create a board for the user
* Add battleships to the board
* Register attacks from the opponent
* Check the status of the board (to see if user lost the game)
